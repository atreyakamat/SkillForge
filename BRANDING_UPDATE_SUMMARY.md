# SkillForge Branding Consistency Update

## Summary
Updated all references throughout the codebase to use "SkillForge" consistently instead of mixed "Skill Gap" / "skill-gap" references.

## Changes Made

### Server-side Updates:
✅ **server/server.js**
- API root message: "Skill Gap Analyzer API root" → "SkillForge API root"
- Service name: "skill-gap-analyzer-api" → "skillforge-api"
- Health endpoint service name updated

### Client-side Updates:
✅ **client/index.html**
- Meta description: "SkillForge - Personal Learning Skill Gap Analyzer" → "SkillForge - Personal Learning and Career Development Platform"

✅ **client/src/pages/Landing.jsx**
- Main heading: "Discover Your Skill Gaps, Accelerate Your Career" → "Forge Your Skills, Accelerate Your Career"
- Description: Updated to focus on skill development rather than gap analysis

✅ **client/src/pages/Login.jsx**
- Subtitle: "Sign in to your Personal Learning Skill Gap Analyzer account" → "Sign in to your SkillForge account"
- Description updated to focus on skill development

✅ **client/src/components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx**
- Registration description: "Join SkillForge to analyze your skill gaps" → "Join SkillForge to develop your professional skills"

✅ **client/src/pages/Assessment.jsx**
- Page title: "Skill Gap Analyzer" → "SkillForge Assessment"

✅ **client/src/components/analytics/GapAnalysis.jsx**

### Project Documentation:
✅ **package.json**
- Description updated to "Personal Learning and Career Development Platform"

✅ **README.md**

### Bug Fixes Applied:
✅ **LoginForm TypeScript Issue**

## Database Configuration
✅ Database name remains "skillforge" (already correctly configured in db.js)

## Testing Results
✅ **Server Health Check**: ✅ Working - returns updated SkillForge branding
✅ **Registration API**: ✅ Working - user creation successful with tokens
✅ **Frontend Access**: ✅ Working - client accessible on http://localhost:5173

## Impact
- Consistent branding throughout the application
- No breaking changes to functionality
- Registration and login APIs continue to work properly
- Database operations unaffected
- User experience improved with coherent messaging

The project now has consistent "SkillForge" branding throughout, positioned as a comprehensive skill development platform rather than just a gap analysis tool.
